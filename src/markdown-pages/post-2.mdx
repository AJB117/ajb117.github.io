I worked through Google's Foobar challenge a couple of months ago, and I
managed to get through round 3, but stopped at round 4 when final exams started up.
I thought one of the problems involved some nice insights that can be explained with
some essential group theory, so I want to write about how it's solved. I don't remember the exact prompt,
and I won't be showing any explicit code in this post in the spirit of the challenge, but I hope
this will be an interesting read.

## Prompt and examples

Given a string representation of an integer, write a function that proceeds as follows:

- Permitting only the removal and rearrangement of digits from the input string,
  return a string representing the largest possible non-zero integer
  the sum of whose digits is divisible by 3.
- If the above is impossible, then return 0.

Some examples:

- `f('369') = '963'` since 9 + 6 + 3 = 18 = 3 \* 6.
- `f('134') = '3'` since we remove `1` and `4`, and 3 = 3 \* 1.
- `f('1100') = '0'` since removing either `1` can't yield a number whose digits sum to a multiple of 3, so we return 0.

For notation's sake, let's call our string $S = s_0s_1\dots s_n$ where each $s_i$ is a digit.

## Naive solution

The most straightforward solution would begin by first sorting the digits of $S$ in descending order.
Then, we iterate through the digits from right to left in order to maintain the largest possible integer.
On digit $s_i$, we test whether $(\Sigma_{j=0}^n s_j) - s_i$ is divisible by 3. If it is, then
we return $S$ without $s_i$. Otherwise, we continue.

We repeat this same process, removing an increasing number of characters from $S$, until the number
of characters removed is equal to $n$, in which case we return 0. For example,
on our second round, for each pair $s_l, s_m$ in $S$ working from
right to left, we would test whether $(\Sigma_{j=0}^n s_j) - s_l - s_m$ is divisible by 3. If it is,
then we would return $S$ without $s_l$ and $s_m$. Otherwise, we continue.

It's easy to see why this solution isn't very efficient. We do one pass of $S$ for each digit
being considered for removal, and the number of digits being considered for removal increases linearly.
The algorithm quickly takes at least quadratic time, and this won't do, especially for long strings.

## A better solution

We can keep the previous solution's decision to sort the digits of $S$ in descending order.
The difference is that, now, we'll be smart about which digits to remove. I'll use some group theory
to explain.

First, consider $\mathbb{Z}_3 = \{0, 1, 2\}$. It's comprised of all of the possible values of
any integer mod 3. I.e., take any integer, and its remainder when divided by 3 will always be in $\mathbb{Z}_3$.
So, $(\Sigma_{j=0}^n s_j)$ % $3$ will always be either 0, 1, or 2. Simple enough.

Now, consider the quotient group $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$. It contains all of the following:

$$
  \{\dots, -3, 0, 3, 6, \dots\}, \\
  \{\dots, -2, 1, 4, 7, \dots\}, \\
  \{\dots, -1, 2, 5, 8, \dots\}
$$

Naturally, we see the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ in the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$ by their respective
cosets ($0 + 3\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 3\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 3\mathbb{Z}$).

Observe that, for any $a \in 2 + 3\mathbb{Z}$ and $b \in 1 + 3\mathbb{Z}$,
$a + b = c \in 0 + 3\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, for any $a, b \in 2 + 3\mathbb{Z}$,
we see $a + b = c \in 1 + 3 \mathbb{Z}$. Something similar occurs for $a, b \in 1 + 3 \mathbb{Z}$
as you might infer. The upshot is that getting to an element in a certain coset in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$
can be thought of as either starting in that coset and adding/subtracting 3 until the element is reached,
or starting in one of the other cosets and adding elements of the other cosets to reach the element.
For instance, 5 = 3 + 1 + 1, 9 = 5 + 4, or 2 = 4 + 7 (mod 3).

With this, returning to digits, we can say that, if $(\Sigma_{j=0}^n s_j)$ % $3 = 1$, either:

- $S$ contains a 1, 4, or 7, and the rest of $s_i$ sum to a number divisible by 3.
- $S$ contains two of the following: 2, 5, 8, and the rest of the $s_i$ sum to a number divisible by 3.

Similarly, if $(\Sigma_{j=0}^n s_j)$ % $3 = 2$, either:

- $S$ contains a 2, 5, or 8, and the rest of $s_i$ sum to a number divisible by 3.
- $S$ contains two of the following: 1, 4, 7, and the rest of $s_i$ sum to a number divisible by 3.

While it's also true that if, say $(\Sigma_{j=0}^n s_j)$ % $3 = 1$, then we could have four 1s or two 7s and two 1s,
the nice part about a group of order 3 is that it's cyclic (per Lagrange's theorem), so you won't ever have
to remove more than 2 digits from $S$.

So now, we have a much nicer algorithm than the naive solution.

- Sort $S$ by descending order.
- As long as $S$ has digits,
  - If $\Sigma s_j$ is divisible by 3, return the sorted $S$.
  - If $\Sigma s_j$ % 3 = 1,
    - If $S$ contains a 1, remove the rightmost 1 and continue. Otherwise, do similarly for 4. Otherwise, do similarly for 7.
    - If $S$ does not contain a 1, 4, or 7, then remove the rightmost occurrences of the smallest pair of digits in {2, 5, 8}.
  - If $\Sigma s_j$ % 3 = 2,
    - If $S$ contains a 2, remove the rightmost 2 and continue. Otherwise, do similarly for 5. Otherwise, do similarly for 8.
    - If $S$ does not contain a 2, 5, or 8, then remove the rightmost occurrences of the smallest pair of digits in {1, 4, 7}.

* Return 0.

This will finish in O(nlogn) time, which is a welcome improvement to the previous algorithm.

## Done

You can probably see how this gets more complicated for versions of the problem that check
for divisibility by other numbers other than 3. Say we check for divisibility by 4. A remainder of 1
could mean we remove a 1, 5, or 9, or a 2 and a 3, or a 6 and a 3. A remainder of 2 could mean we remove
a 2 or 6, or two 1s, or a 1 and a 5, or two 3s. The divisibility by 3 case is easier to think about.

Hopefully this was a fun read. By no means should you need any of the above group theory stuff
to solve the original problem, but it was cool to explore how it can explain one of the problem's solutions.
